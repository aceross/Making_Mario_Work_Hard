Making Mario Work Hard
======================

This project attempts to visualise Boolean satisfiability problems as a video game level. To do this, the program reads in a satisfiability formula and generates a game level. The level is then completed by the program if the formula is satisfiable. This software was originally developed as my thesis project for the the MSc in Computer Science at the Univesity of Bristol. 

It is still in a very developmental state. The project will progress in due course.

Usage
-----

This program has been developed on a *nix system. At the present moment, I have no instructions for running it on Windows.

Usage is simple - navigate to the directory and run `make`. After the project is built, run `./bin/game`
