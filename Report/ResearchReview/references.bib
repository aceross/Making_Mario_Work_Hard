  Abstract                 = {The problem SAT of CNF-Satisfiability is the prototype of NP-complete problems. In this problem the question is whether there exists a truth assignment such that each clause contains at least one true literal. Conversely, the problem 1-At-Most-SAT, in which the question is whether there exists a truth assignment so that each clause contains at most one true literal, is polynomial-time decidable. We define an infinite class of problems SAT(ℒ1,…,ℒp), parametrized by symmetric polynomial-time decidable languages and generalizing usual satisfiability problems. For instance, the two problems previously considered are, respectively, parametrized by the languages corresponding to the regular expressions 0*1(0 + 1)* and 0* + 0*10*. We prove a dichotomy theorem for these satisfiability problems with symmetric polynomial clauses: SAT(ℒ1,…,ℒp) is either polynomial or NP-complete. We also show a dichotomy result for the corresponding counting problems. #SAT(ℒ1,…,ℒp) is either in FP or #P-complete. Besides, we provide a normal form characterization of the symmetric regular languages ℒ leading to a polynomial-time decidable problem SAT(ℒ). This characterization induces an algorithm to decide whether a given problem SAT(ℒ1,…,ℒp) is polynomial-time decidable, provided that the languages ℒ1,…,ℒp are symmetric and regular.},
